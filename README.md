A recommendation system is a tool that helps to predict the preferences or ratings a user would give to a product or item. The purpose of a recommendation system is to provide users with personalized suggestions, based on their past interactions and behavior.

There are several advantages to using recommendation systems, including:

•	Increased engagement: By providing users with personalized recommendations, you can increase their engagement with your products or services. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
•	Improved user experience: Recommendation systems can help to streamline the user experience by reducing the time and effort required to find relevant products or content.
•	Increased sales: By providing users with relevant recommendations, you can increase the likelihood that they will make a purchase. This can result in increased sales and revenue for your business.

In conclusion, recommendation systems offer a range of benefits to businesses and organizations, by helping to increase engagement, improve the user experience, increase sales, and provide valuable customer insights.
There are different types of recommender systems, and they are:

### Objectives

Create a recommendation system made with Content Based Filtering, this program is well explained in the notebook RecSys-Content-Based-movies.ipynb.

Also was created a recommendation system based in Collaborative Filtering, this program is well explained in the notebook RecSys-Collaborative-Filtering-movies.ipynb.

The Recommendation Systems made with Contain Based Filtering works by comparing between data that the user has seen before. And the Recommendation Systems made with  Collaborative Filtering works by comparing between data of other users with similar likes.

These systems have become ubiquitous can be commonly seen in online stores, movies databases and job finders. In these notebooks, we will explore recommendation systems based on Collaborative Filtering and Content Filtering. I implemented simple version using Python and the Pandas library.

All the process was deeply described on the notebooks: Acquiring Data, Preprocessing, Filtering and a lists of Advantages and Disadvantages of each one of the Recommendation Systems. The results and Conclusions are inside too.
