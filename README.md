### Dataset Description

The dataset used contains information taken from the users of an application where the people can watch movies. And we can Download it from this Link: https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%205/data/moviedataset.zip

Due it is a long dataset, I can't upload it to the GitHub Page. So please click the previous link to download it.

The dataset was obtained thanks GroupLens. GroupLens Research has collected and made available rating data sets from the MovieLens web site (https://movielens.org). The data sets were collected over various periods of time, depending on the size of the set. It is important know that for use these data sets we have to review their README files for the usage licences and other details. 

### Objectives

Create a recommendation system made with Content Based Filtering, this program is well explained in the notebook RecSys-Content-Based-movies.ipynb.

Also was created a recommendation system based in Collaborative Filtering, this program is well explained in the notebook RecSys-Collaborative-Filtering-movies.ipynb.

The Recommendation Systems made with Contain Based Filtering works by comparing between data that the user has seen before. And the Recommendation Systems made with  Collaborative Filtering works by comparing between data of other users with similar likes.

These systems have become ubiquitous can be commonly seen in online stores, movies databases and job finders. In these notebooks, we will explore recommendation systems based on Collaborative Filtering and Content Filtering. I implemented simple version using Python and the Pandas library.

All the process was deeply described on the notebooks: Acquiring Data, Preprocessing, Filtering and a lists of Advantages and Disadvantages of each one of the Recommendation Systems. The results and Conclusions are inside too.
